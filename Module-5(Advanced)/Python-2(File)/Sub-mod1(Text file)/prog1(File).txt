File
-----
1) What  does  a  file  contain  ? --->  A  group  of  characters  (or)  objects

2) What  is  the  file  with  characters  called  ?  --->  Text  file
     What  is  the  file  with  objects  called  ?  ---> Binary  file

3) Where  does  file  reside ?  --->  On  external  (or)  secondary  memory  such  as  harddisk , cd  and  pendrive
    Where  does  object  reside ?  --->  In  heap  memory  (or)  primary  memory (or)  main  memory  (or) RAM

4) When  is  file  recommmended ?  ---> When  the  program  demands  huge  number  of  inputs

5) Is  file  permanent  (or)  temporary ?  --->  Permanent  becoz  it  is  on  secondary  memory
    What  about  object ?  --->  Temporary  becoz  it  is  in  heap  memory

6) Is  file  lost  soon  after  program  terminates ?  --->  No  and  it  is  alive
     What  about  object ?  --->  Lost  soon  after  program  terminates

7) Can  a  program  access  file  created  by  a  different  program ?  --->  Yes  becoz  it  is  alive
    What  about  object ?  ---> It  can  be  accessed  by  same  program  where  it  was  created

8) Is  file  access  slow  (or)  fast ?  --->  Slow  becoz  file  is  on  external  memory  such  as  disk
     What  about  object  ?  --->  Fast  in  access  becoz  it  is  in  heap  memory

9) Therefore  minimize  file  access
     i.e.  Don't  access  file  frequently

10) In  other  words,  program  execution  becomes  slow  when  file  is  accessed  frequently

11) Is  file  limited  (or) umlimited ?  --->  Unlimited
     What  about  object ?  ---> Unlimited

12) In  other  words,  file  can  hold  any  amount  of  data  and  it  never  becomes  full  (Just  like  object)

13) Is  it  possible  to  read  from  the  file  ?  --->  Yes  with  read() , readline() , readlines()  methods  and  for  loop
      Is  it  possible  to  write  to  the  file ? ---> Yes  with  write()  and  writelines()  methods

14) In  other  words,  I/O  operations  can  be  made  on  the  file

15) Program  can  be  instructed  to  read  inputs  from  a  file,  process  them  and  write  results  to  a  different  file

Note:
1) File  can  be  used  as  an  alternative  to  I / O  devices

2) What  does  input()  function  do ?  --->  Reads  input  from  keyboard
     What  does  read()  method  do ?  ---> Reads  input  from  the  file

3) What  does  print()  function  do ?  --->  Prints  results  on  console
     What  does  write()  method  do ?  ---> Writes  results  to  file
