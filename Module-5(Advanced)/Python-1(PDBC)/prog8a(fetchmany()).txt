-------------------------
1) list = cur . fetchmany(n)

    Can  cursor  be  closed ? --->   No  becoz  all  the  tuples  of  the  cursor  are  not  yielded
					           and  cur . close()  throws  InternalError
    What  is  the  value  of  cur . rowcount  after  execution  of  fetchmany(3) ?  --->  3

4) What  does  fetchmany(7)  do  if  there  are  5  tuples ?  ---> Yiedls  all  the  tuples (i.e. 5)  into  a  list  and  returns  the  list
    Can  cursor  be  closed ? --->  Yes  becoz  all  the  tuples  are  yielded
    What  is  the  value  of  cur . rowcount  after  execution  of  fetchmany(7) ?  ---> 5

5) What  does  fetchmany(0)  do  ?  --->  Yields  first  tuple  of  the  cursor  into  a  list  and  returns  list

6) What  does  fetchmany(-1)  do  ?  --->   Yields  nothing  from  the  cursor  and  returns  an  empty  list

7) What  does  fetchmany(No-args)  do  ?  --->  Yields  first  tuple  of  the  cursor  into  a  list  and  returns  list

8) Where  is  fetchmany()  method  defined ?  --->  In  Mysqlcursor  class

9) What  is  the  disadvantage  of  fetchmany(10000)  method ?  --->
									Waiting  time  and  Memory  Error   due  to  large  number  10000
