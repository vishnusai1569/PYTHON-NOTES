rowcount   variable
-----------------------
1) What  is  the  value  of  rowcount  variable  in  general ?  --->   Number of  tuples  yielded  from  the  cursor

2) If  there  are  4  tuples,
    What  is  the value  of  cur . rowcount  variable  after  execution  of  cur . fetchall() ?  --->  4

3) If  there  are  4  tuples,
    What  is  the value  of  cur . rowcount  variable  after  execution  of  cur . fetchmany(3) ?  --->  3

4) If  there  are  4  tuples,
    What  is  the value  of  cur . rowcount  variable  after  execution  of  cur . fetchmany(7) ?  --->  4

5) If  there  are  4  tuples,
    What  is  the value  of  cur . rowcount  variable  after  execution  of  cur . fetchmany(1) ?  --->
												1  becoz  1  tuple  is  fetched  from  the  cursor

6) If  there  are  4  tuples,
    What  is  the value  of  cur . rowcount  variable  after  execution  of  cur . fetchmany(-1) ?  ---> -1  but  not  0

7) tpl = cur . fetchone()
    print(cur . rowcount) --->  1
    tpl = cur . fetchone()
    print(cur . rowcount) --->  2
    tpl = cur . fetchone()
    print(cur . rowcount) ---> 3
    and  so  on
