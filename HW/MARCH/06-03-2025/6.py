Write  a  program  to  print  characters  at  even  and  odd  indexes  without  slice


							 0      1      2      3     4     5     6      7
Let  input  be        R      a     m      a             R     a      o

odd =  '' + 'a' + 'a' + 'R' + 'o' = 'aaRo'
even =   '' + 'R' + 'm' + ' ' + 'a' =  'Rm a'

1) What  action  to  be  made  when  index  is  even ?  --->  Concatenate  the  character  to  even  object

2) What  action  to  be  made  when  index  is  odd ?  ---> Concatenate  the  characeter  to  odd  object

3) Hint: Use  single  for  loop

k=input("enter the string:")

    if i%2==0:
        even += k[i]
    else:
        odd += k[i]
print("Characters  at  even  indexes  :",len(odd))
print("Characters  at  even  indexes  :",len(even))
