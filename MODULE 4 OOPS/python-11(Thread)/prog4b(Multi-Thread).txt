Multi-Threading
-------------------
1) What  is  a  thread ?  --->  It  is  a  separate  flow  of  execution  which  is  independent  of  others

2) What  is  a  program ?  --->  A  group  of  threads  where  each  thread  does  a  different  task

3) What  does  a  thread  do ?  --->  Executes  function  (or)  method (or)  run()  method

4) How  many  threads  can  be  in  a  program ?  --->  At   least  one  thread  i.e.  main  thread

5) Who  creates  main  thread  ?  --->  PVM

6) When  is  main  thread  created  ?  --->  As  soon  as  program  is  executed  by  py  filename . py

7) What  does  main  thread  do ?  --->  Executes  python  program

8) Is  Thread  a  class ?  --->  Yes  and  it  is  pre-defined  in  threading  module

9) Can  main  thread  create  child  threads ?  --->  Yes

10) How  to  create  a  thread ?  --->  t = Thread()

11) t  =  Thead(target = f1)
      t . start()
      What  does  thread  't'  do ?  ---> Executes  f1  function  becoz  target = f1

12) How  are  threads  executed ? --->  All  the  threads  are  executed  parallelly  or  concurrently  on  round  robin
							      basis  with   a  fixed  time  slice (may  be  1  micro  second)

13) Who  is  executing  all  the  threads  ?  --->  Thread  Scheduler (TS)  which  is  a  part  of  PVM

14) In  other  words,  TS  controls  all  the  threads

15) Let  program  contain  4  threads    t1 , t2 , t3  and  t4
      Threads  :                       t1              t2           t3            t4
      Execution  time    :         3.5            4.5          1.5            2.5
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Interval  1                      1                1             1               1
       Interval  2                     1                 1            0.5            1
       Interval  3                     1                 1          dead          0.5
       Interval  4                    0.5               1         dead           dead
       Interval  5                    dead            0.5      dead           dead
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Above  table  demonstrates  round  robin  with  a  time  slice  of  1  micro  second

17) What  are  the  advantages  of  Round  Robin ?
       a) Waiting  time  is  reduced
            Eg:  t4  has  to  wait  for  9.5  micro seconds  to  get  a  chance  to  execute  when  threads  are  executed  sequentially.
                  But  in  case  of  Round  Robin,  t4  waits  for  three  micro  seconds
                  In  other  words,  each  thread  gains  TS  focus  immediately
      b) Small  threads  are  finished  first  and  large  threads  are  finished  later

18) Therefore  every  thread  feels  that  TS  is  executing  only  that  thread  but  in  the  reality  multiple  threads  are
       being  executed  concurrently
