Types  of   multi-tasking
-----------------------------
1) Process  based  multi  tasking(PBMT)

2) Thread  based  multi  tasking(TBMT)

 Process  based  multi  tasking  Vs   Thread  based  multi  tasking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What  is  PBMT ?  ---> Muitiple  programs  are  under   execution  concurrently
                                        Eg: Type  a  program  in  Notepad,
				               Download  something  from  internet  explorer,
				               Listen  to  music  in  Mp3  window,
				               run  a  python  program  at  command  prompt
   What  is  TBMT ?  ---> Muitiple  threads  are  under   execution  concurrently
		                       Eg: Notepad  has  multiple  threads
				             i.e. One  thread  echoes  text  in  notepad  editor,
				                  another  thread  does  word  wrap,
					          3rd  thread  prints  text  on  printer  and  so  on

2) What  is  the  smallest  unit  in  PBMT ?  --->  Process  (or)  program
    What  is  the  smallest  unit  in  TBMT ?  --->  Thread  i.e. Part  of  the  program

3) Is  process  a  big  picture  (or)  small  picture ?  --->  Big  picture
    What  about  thread ?  ---> Small  picture

4) Why  is  process  called  heavy  weight ?  --->
							Since  it  requires  more  memory, too  many  resources  and  lot  of  processor  time
    Why  is  thread  called  light  weight ?  --->
							Since  it  requires  small  memory, few  resources  and  small  processor time

5) Who  controls  all  the  processes ?  --->  O.S.
     Who  controls  all  the  threads ?  ---> Thread  scheduler  which  is  a  part  of  PVM

6) What  about  inter  process  communication ?  --->  Costly  and  limited
    What  about  inter  thread  communication ?  ---> Cheap  due  to  notify()

7) What  about  context  switch  from  one  process  to  another  process ?  --->
												Takes  longer  time  becoz  process  is  heavy  weight
    What  about  context  switch  from  one  thread  to  another ?  --->
												Takes  small  time  becoz  thread  is  light  weight

8) What  is  context  switch ?  --->  Saving  details  in  the  stack  and  removing  details  from  the  stack.
							(Details  like  address  of  next  statement  and  values  of  objects)
