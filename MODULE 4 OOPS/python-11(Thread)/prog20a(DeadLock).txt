Deadlock
-----------
1) Thread  t1  requires  2  objects  for  execution

2) Thread  t2  also  requires  same  objects  for  execution

3) t1  holds (or) locks  first  object  and  t2  holds  2nd  object

4) t1  waits  for  2nd  object  which  is  held  by  t2  and
    t2  waits  for  1st  object   which  is  held  by  t1

5) Therefore  both  t1  and  t2  wait  forever  and  this  is  called  deadlock

6) Neither  t1  can  complete  execution  nor  t2
