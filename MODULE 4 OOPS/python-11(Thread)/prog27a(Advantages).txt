Advantages  of  thread
---------------------------
1) If  a  single  thread  executes  whole  program,
    program  execution  is  slow  becoz  all  the  methods  and  functions  are  executed  by  only  one  thread

2) On  the  otherhand,  distribute  the  work  among  threads  and
    ensure  that  each  thread  executes  a  different  function  or  method ,
    execution  becomes  faster  due  to  concurrent  execution  of  threads
