Thread  Implementation
-----------------------------
What  are  the  three  ways  to  implement a  thread ?  --->  With  function ,  method  and  run()  method

Function
----------
1) How  to  create  a  thread  with  function  target ?  --->  t = Thread(target = f1)  where  f1  is  function

2) t = Thread(target = f1)
    t . start()
    What  does  thread  't'  do ?   ---> Executes  f1  function  becoz  target = f1

3) t = Thread()
     What  is  the  default  target ?  ---> Empty  run()  method  of  Thread  class

4) t = Thread()
    t . start()
    What  does  thread  't'  do ?   ---> Executes  empty  run()  method  of  Thread  class


Method
---------
1) How  to  create  a  thread  with  method  target ?  --->  t = Thread(target = object . method)

2) a = c1()
    t = Thread(target = a . m1)
    t . start()
    What  does  thread  't'  do ?   --->  Executes  m1  method  of  class  c1   becoz   'a'  is  c1  class  object

3) How  to  create  a  thread  with  static  (or)  class  method  target ?  ---> t = Thread(target = classname . method)

4) t = Thread(target = c1 . m2)
    t . start()
    What  does  thread  't'  do ?  ---> Executes  m2  method  of  class  c1  where  m2  is  static  (or)  class  method

run()  method
-----------------
1) When  is  a  class  called  Thread ? --->  When  it  is  a  child  class  of  Thread

2) class  MyThread(Thread):
     	    def  run(self):
		   statements
    Is  MyThread  a  thread  class ?  ---> Yes  becoz  it  is  a  child  class  of  Thread

3) Where  is  Thread  class  defined ?  --->  In  threading  module

4) What  are  the  methods  of  Thread  class ?  --->  start()  method ,  empty  run()  method  and  so  on

5) What  does  MyThread  class  do ? --->  Overrides  empty  run()  method  of  Thread  class

6) How  to  create  a  thread  ?  --->t =  MyThread()

7) t . start()
    What  does  thread  't'  do ?  ---> Executes  run()  method  of  MyThread  class  becoz  't'  is  MyThread  class  object

8) What  does  thread  do  when  there  is  no  run()  method  in  MyThread  class ?  --->
												Executes  empty  run()  method  of  Thread  class

9) How  many  arguments  can  run()  method  take ?  --->  None  except  self

10) t = MytThread()
      t . start()
      Which  class  start()  method  is  executed ?  --->
					start()  method  of  Thread  class  becoz  there  is  no  start()  method  in  MyThread  class

11) What  happens  when  MyThread  class  is  not  a  child  class  of  Thread ?  --->
							t . start()  throws  error  becoz  there  is  no  start()  method  in  MyThread  class
