Life  Cycle  of  a  Thread
-----------------------------
1) What  are  the  five  states  of  a  thread ?  ---> a) New  (or) Borne  state
										 b)  Ready  (or)  Runnable  state
										 c)  Running  state
										 d) Waiting  (or)  Blocked  state
										 e)  Halted  (or)  Dead  state

2) What  is  new  (or)  borne  state ?  --->  A  new  thread  is  created
    What  is  the  statement  for  a  thread  to  enter  into  new  (or)  born  state ? ---> t = Thread(target = f1)

3) What  is  ready  (or)  runnable  state ?  ---> Thread  is  ready  for  execution
    What  is  the  statement  for  a  thread  to  enter  into  ready  (or)  runnable  state ?  ---> t . start()

4) What  is  running  state ?  --->  Thread  is  executing  function , method  (or)  run()  method
    What  is  the  statement  for  a  thread  to  enter  into  running  state ?  --->  Nothing

5) In  other  words,  thread  enters  into  running  state  as  soon  as  TS  picks  the  thread  for  execution

6) Every  thread  toggles  between  ready  and  running  states

7) A  thread  moves  to  ready  state  from  running  state  as  soon  as  time  is  elapsed  and
    thread  moves  into  running  state  from  ready  state  as  soon  as  it  is  picked  by  TS

8) What  is  waiting  (or)  blocked  state ?  --->  Thread  can  not  continue  execution  due  to
									    sleep() , join() , wait()  and  acquire()

9) In  other  words,  thread  is  suspended  from  execution

10) What  does  time . sleep(1)  do?  --->  The  thread  moves  to  waiting  state
     How  long  does  the  thread  wait ?  --->   For  one  second
     What  happens  after  1  sec  is  elapsed ?  ---> The  sleeping  thread  moves  to  ready  state  and  is  ready  for  execution

11) What  does  t2 . join()  do ?  ---> The   thread  moves  to  waiting  state
      How  long  does  the  thread  wait ?  ---> As  long  as  thread  t2  is  under  execution
								       i.e. until  thread  t2  is  expired
      What  happens  after  thread  t2  is  expired ?  --->
								The  waiting  thread  moves  to  ready  state  and  is  ready  for  execution

12) What  does  cond . wait()  do ?  --->  The  thread  moves  to  waiting  state
      How  long  does  the  thread  wait ?  --->  As  long  as  it  is  not  notified
								        i.e.  Until  some  thread  executes  notify()
      What  happens  after  it  gets  notified ?  ---> The  waiting  thread  moves  to  ready  state  and  is  ready  for  execution

13) What  does  l . acquire()  do  when  object  'l'  is  already  locked ?  ---> The  thread  moves  to  waiting  state
      How  long  does  the  thread  wait ?  --->   As  long  as  object  'l'  is  locked
      What  happens  after  object  'l'  is  unlocked ?  --->
									The  waiting  thread  moves  to  ready  state  and  is  ready  for  execution

14) What  is  halted  (or) dead  state ?  --->  Target  function  (or)  method  terminates
