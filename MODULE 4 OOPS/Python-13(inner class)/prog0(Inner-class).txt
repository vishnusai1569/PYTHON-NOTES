Nesting  of  classes  (or)  Inner  class
-------------------------------------------
1) What  is  nesting  of  classes ?  --->  A  class  defined  in  another  class
							     Eg:  class  outer:
								           methods
								           class  inner:
									          methods
								           methods

2) What  are  the  two  ways  to  create  inner class  object ?  --->
     a) outerclassobject .  inner()
	 Eg:  o = outer()  --->  creates  outer  class  object
	        i = o . inner()  --->  creates  inner  class  object  wrt  outer  class  object
    b) outerclassname . inner()
        Eg:  i  =  outer . inner()   --->  creates  inner  class  object  thur  outer  class  name

4) o = outer()
     i = o . inner()
     How  to  reduce  the  two  statements  to  a  single  statement  ?  --->  i = outer() . inner()

5) Is  i =  inner()  valid ? ---> No  becoz  inner  class  object  can  not  be  created  without
					      outer  class  object  (or)  outer  class  name

6) Where  can  inner  class  object  be  created ?  ---> Any  where  in  the  program

7) There  is  a  strong  bonding  between  outer  class  and  inner  class


Note:
1) class   University:
             class   Department:
		                 ...
    There  can  not  be  university  without  department.
     If  university  is  closed, department  is  automatically  closed

2) class   Car:
            class  Engine:
                   ......
    There  can  not  be  a  car  without  engine.
